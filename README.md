To push to main:

- create a branch titled yourTag/branchTitle -> git branch yourTag/branchTitle
- checkout that branch -> git checkout yourTag/branchTitle
- make desired changes in your IDE
- commit and push those changes in yout IDE using UI or terminal
- ensure your code runs/builds succesfully
- submit a PR on github for your branch to be merged into main
- review code and then merge

  **DO NOT** push directly to main or push code that will not run to main. Main should be stable and able to run at all times.
